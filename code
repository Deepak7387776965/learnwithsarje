# You would need to install the 'mnemonic' library first:
# pip install mnemonic

from mnemonic import Mnemonic

# Initialize Mnemonic with the English wordlist
# This uses the official BIP39 wordlist, not the words from your PDF.
mnemo = Mnemonic("english")

# Generate a 12-word mnemonic phrase (128 bits of entropy)
# This is a valid BIP39 mnemonic
words = mnemo.generate(128)

print("Generated BIP39 Mnemonic Phrase:")
print(words)

# To check if it's valid (optional, but good for verification)
is_valid = mnemo.check(words)
print(f"\nIs the generated phrase a valid BIP39 mnemonic? {is_valid}")

# You can also convert a mnemonic to a seed (for key generation)
seed = mnemo.to_seed(words, passphrase="") # Passphrase can be empty or a custom string
print(f"\nSeed (hex): {seed.hex()}")
